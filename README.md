Substitution Ciphers : They are one of the oldest and simplest methods of encryption. They involve replacing plain text letters or characters with others in a fixed pattern to create a cipher text.
They represent probably the most widely used encryption system in antiquity.

Overview : Sender sends a message to the reciever -> An intruder intercepts the message but is encrypted -> The reciever decrypts the message. Both sender/reciever can encrypt/decrypt a message using a dictionary(that maps plain text to cipher text)
